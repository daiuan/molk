                        <p>Through history there were facts that influenced deaf people's education. For a long time, the deaf were seen as
                            inhuman and even as unteachable people, with a superficial effort made to offer the necessary conditions to them to
                            grow themselves up.
                            After lots of years of discrimination and exclusion, the deaf were looked out for the first time in 1760 when the
                            religious Michel de L'Epée made up the first Deaf School, seeking the education of people who had this limitations.

                <p>In Brazil, deaf people's education started when the deaf profesor Eduard Huet came to Rio de Janeiro requested by Emperor D. Pedro II, founded in 1857 the first institution with the focus on it, the National Institute of Deaf Education (INES).
                    Inside this theme perspective, the Santa Terezinha Institute (Created in São Paulo in the century XX) has been organising itself with the bilingual philosophy - first the deaf learn the sign language and then the written portuguese

                    <p>One of those events were the march “Surdos Venceremos”, made in September 1994 and included fights for the
                        official recognizement of the Libras, right to education and provisioning of interpreters. Only in 2002 Libras
                        was finally recognized as a Brazil official language.
                
                        At CONAE (National Education Conference) of 2010, with the goal of elaborating a national education plan, there
                        was a regression on deaf education, since that only 3 of the 11 proposals made by the deaf community were
                        attended. In 2011, it was announced that INES would be closed and their students should be transferred to common
                        schools, which caused huge revolts of the deaf community.

                <p>Many times, you could believe that the problem of the deaf exclusion could be solved by mixed classes, which include
                    deaf students with non-deaf students. It's not effective, because even with interpreters, the deaf would not receive
                    the necessary attention to their limitations. The learning to who has any kind of limitation happens in a different
                    time, needing much more than one interpreter.
                
                    That way, even with lots of actions being taken seeking an upgrade on the deaf people's education and also in their
                    inclusion in society, It will still have some limitations, for example the fact that Libras is not "popular", and
                    just some educators have a total domain of the language. The specialised institutions are very rare, which give us
                    barely ways to learn Libras
