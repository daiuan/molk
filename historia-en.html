                <p>Deaf People History (in Brazil)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="horizontal">
                <div class="texto1">
                    <p>The history of the deaf in Brazil starts in the beginning of the Second Empire. As already said, invited by Dom Pedro
                        II, the french priest and professor Eduard Huet came to Brazil to teach a methodology already used in France and
                        other european countries for deaf education.
                        Due to Huet’s work, it was founded in Brazil, in 1857 in “cidade do Rio de Janeiro”, the Deaf-Mute National Imperial
                        Institute (INES), that only served male deaf students. In São Paulo, in 1929, was founded the Santa Terezinha
                        Institute, which came to serve female deaf students too.
                        In educational politics, the french method was used, since Libras (the brazilian sign language) was created based on
                        the french sign language, methodic signs used by Eduard Huet and signs already used by the deaf people community in
                        Brazil.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="imagem1">
                    <img src="img/historia-sur.jpg">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="texto2">
                <p>In 1880, it was decided at the Milan Congress that deaf education should not be based on signs, but on orality by
                    lip-reading. That decision has not stopped deaf people from using sign language, but it caused a regression in
                    their education.
            
                    Rio de Janeiro is seen as the place of origin of the brazilian sign language, because it was there where INES
                    was founded and by other events that succeeded the Institute foundation. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="texto3">
                <p>One of those events were the march “Surdos Venceremos”, made in September 1994 and included fights for the official
                    recognizement of the Libras, right to education and provisioning of interpreters. Only in 2002 Libras was finally
                    recognized as a Brazil official language.
                
                    At CONAE (National Education Conference) of 2010, with the goal of elaborating a national education plan, there was
                    a regression on deaf education, since that only 3 of the 11 proposals made by the deaf community were attended. In
                    2011, it was announced that INES would be closed and their students should be transferred to common schools, which
                    caused huge revolts of the deaf community.

                <div class="texto4">
                    <p>Even with many revolts, starting from September 2011 things started to get better: it was defined that 26th September would be the National Deaf Day and in 28th May 2012 there was a victory at the Lower House, with the inclusion of bilingual (portuguese and Libras) schools and classes, in addition to inclusive schools.
